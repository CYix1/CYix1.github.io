<p>Search-based Procedural content generation is the use of evolutionary computation and similar methods to generate game content.</p>
<p>Represent content so it will become searchable =&gt; create evaluation function.</p>
<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<p>A Search-based approach to solving a content generation problem consists of following core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A search algorithm</strong> is the &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of a Search-based method. Often a relatively simple evolutionary algorithm works well enough. Sometimes more sophisticated (e.g taking constrains into account) or specialized algorithms are better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A content representation</strong> of artefacts you want to create, e.g levels, quests or winged kittens. The content representation defines and limits what content can be generated and determines whether effective search is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One or more evaluation Functions</strong>. An evaluation function is a function from an artefacts to a number indicating the quality of the artefact. E.g the playability of a level, the intricacy of a quest or the aesthetic appeal of a winged kitten. (the hardest part)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="evolutionary-search-algorithms">Evolutionary search algorithms</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inspired by darwinian evolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>population of individuals (condidate solutions) are evaluated in each generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fittest(highest evaulated) individual gets the chance to reproduce (lowest ones are removed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A generation can be divided into selection and reproduction phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reproduction with recombination or crossover of characteristics Or small random changes (mutation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genetic algorithms rely more on recombination and less on mutation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using multiple evaluation functions, since it is hard to describe every quality inside one number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single objective evolutionary algorithm</strong>: evaluation algorithm could beccombines as a weighted usm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi objective evolutionary algorithm</strong>, optimized for several objectives at the same time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Include evolution strategy example #TODO</p>
<h2 id="other-types-of-search-algorithms">Other types of search algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>exhaustive search algorithm, brute force through all possible configutations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>random serach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solver-based approaches, see <a href="08_Answer_Set_programming_%28ASP%29.md">08_Answer_Set_programming_(ASP)</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="content-representation">Content representation</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The solutions in the generation space are usually encoded as genotypes. E.g instructions for creating a Game level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genotypes are later converted into phenotypes, the actual entities of the game. E.g actual game level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Example] Example representations of a level in Super Mario Bros</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly, as a level map (each genotype equals a &ldquo;block&rdquo; in phenotype )</li>
<li>more indirectly, as a list of positions and properties of different entities</li>
<li>even more indirectly, as a repository of different reusable patters and a list of how they are distributed across the level map</li>
<li>Very indirectly, as a list of desirable properties such as number of gaps, enemies, coins, width of gaps</li>
<li>Most indirectly, as a random number seed</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p> - The larger the search space, the harder it is (in general) to find a certain solution!
 - high locality, small change in genotype results in a small change to the phenotype and fitness value.
 - idk what they talked about with expressive range etc.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation-functions">Evaluation Functions</h1>
<ul>
<li>function which assigns a fitness/evaluation value to each candidate.</li>
<li>no good evaluation function =&gt; &ldquo;no good content&rdquo;</li>
<li>three distinctions of evaluation functions: <strong>direct</strong>, <strong>simulation-based</strong>, and <strong>interactive</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="direct-evaluation-functions">Direct evaluation functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>mapping between generated content to a content quality value</li>
<li>fast and relatively easy to implement but hard to devise</li>
<li><strong>Theory-driven function</strong>
<ul>
<li>guided by intuition and/or qualitative theories of player experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data-driven function</strong>
<ul>
<li>based on quantitative measures of player experience.</li>
<li>approximation of mapping through questionnaires or physiological measurements
