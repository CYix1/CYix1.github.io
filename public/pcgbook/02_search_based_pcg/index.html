<p>Search-based Procedural content generation is the use of evolutionary computation and similar methods to generate game content.</p>
<p>Represent content so it will become searchable =&gt; create evaluation function.</p>
<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<p>A Search-based approach to solving a content generation problem consists of following core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A search algorithm</strong> is the &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of a Search-based method. Often a relatively simple evolutionary algorithm works well enough. Sometimes more sophisticated (e.g taking constrains into account) or specialized algorithms are better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A content representation</strong> of artefacts you want to create, e.g levels, quests or winged kittens. The content representation defines and limits what content can be generated and determines whether effective search is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One or more evaluation Functions</strong>. An evaluation function is a function from an artefacts to a number indicating the quality of the artefact. E.g the playability of a level, the intricacy of a quest or the aesthetic appeal of a winged kitten. (the hardest part)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="evolutionary-search-algorithms">Evolutionary search algorithms</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inspired by darwinian evolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>population of individuals (condidate solutions) are evaluated in each generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fittest(highest evaulated) individual gets the chance to reproduce (lowest ones are removed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A generation can be divided into selection and reproduction phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reproduction with recombination or crossover of characteristics Or small random changes (mutation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genetic algorithms rely more on recombination and less on mutation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using multiple evaluation functions, since it is hard to describe every quality inside one number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single objective evolutionary algorithm</strong>: evaluation algorithm could beccombines as a weighted usm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi objective evolutionary algorithm</strong>, optimized for several objectives at the same time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Include evolution strategy example #TODO</p>
<h2 id="other-types-of-search-algorithms">Other types of search algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>exhaustive search algorithm, brute force through all possible configutations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>random serach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solver-based approaches, see [[08_Answer_Set_programming_(ASP)]]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="content-representation">Content representation</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The solutions in the generation space are usually encoded as genotypes. E.g instructions for creating a Game level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genotypes are later converted into phenotypes, the actual entities of the game. E.g actual game level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Example] Example representations of a level in Super Mario Bros</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly, as a level map (each genotype equals a &ldquo;block&rdquo; in phenotype )</li>
<li>more indirectly, as a list of positions and properties of different entities</li>
<li>even more indirectly, as a repository of different reusable patters and a list of how they are distributed across the level map</li>
<li>Very indirectly, as a list of desirable properties such as number of gaps, enemies, coins, width of gaps</li>
<li>Most indirectly, as a random number seed</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p> - The larger the search space, the harder it is (in general) to find a certain solution!
 - high locality, small change in genotype results in a small change to the phenotype and fitness value.
 - idk what they talked about with expressive range etc.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation-functions">Evaluation Functions</h1>
<ul>
<li>function which assigns a fitness/evaluation value to each candidate.</li>
<li>no good evaluation function =&gt; &ldquo;no good content&rdquo;</li>
<li>three distinctions of evaluation functions: <strong>direct</strong>, <strong>simulation-based</strong>, and <strong>interactive</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="direct-evaluation-functions">Direct evaluation functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>mapping between generated content to a content quality value</li>
<li>fast and relatively easy to implement but hard to devise</li>
<li><strong>Theory-driven function</strong>
<ul>
<li>guided by intuition and/or qualitative theories of player experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data-driven function</strong>
<ul>
<li>based on quantitative measures of player experience.</li>
<li>approximation of mapping through questionnaires or physiological measurements
Examples missing #TODO</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simulation-based-evaluation-functions">Simulation-based evaluation functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use of AI agents to play and estimate the generated contents quality</li>
<li><strong>static function</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assumption of maintaining agent behaviour during gamepla</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>dynamic function</strong>
<ul>
<li>Agent that adapts during gameplay
Examples missing #TODO</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interactive-evaluation-functions">Interactive evaluation functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>evaluation based on interaction with a human.</li>
<li><strong>implicit</strong> and <strong>explicit</strong> collection of data</li>
<li>explicit is more reliatble and accurate</li>
<li>implicit is more noisy and based on assumptions.
Examples missing #TODO</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="example-games">Example Games</h1>
<h2 id="starcraft">StarCraft</h2>
<p><strong>Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maps are represented as vectors of real numbers</li>
<li>Genotype-to phenotype process: intepreted directly or further processed</li>
<li>results in a matrix which can be automatically converted into a Starcraft map
<strong>Evaluation</strong>:</li>
<li>Different evaluation functions mostly based on calculations of free space and shortest paths</li>
<li>functions adress base placement, resource placement and paths between bases</li>
<li>E.g. enough space to grow a base, equal access to nearby resources or choke points
<strong>Algorithm</strong>:</li>
<li>Uses SMS-EMOA (a state of the art multiobjective evolutionary algorithm)</li>
<li>SMS-EMOA used to evolve combinations of two to three objectives.</li>
<li>partial conflicts between several objectives were found</li>
<li>=&gt; impossible to maximize all objectives</li>
<li>but interesting and reasonably fair maps were found</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="racing-tracks">Racing tracks</h2>
<p><strong>Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>tracks are represented as vectors of real numbers</li>
<li>interpreted as control points of splines
<strong>Evaluation</strong>:</li>
<li>track personalization based on modelling the playing style of that player.</li>
<li>=&gt; teaching a neural network to play like that player</li>
<li>candidate track is evaluatied in a simulation-based manner</li>
<li>measurements of appropriate challenge and diversity for the player
<strong>Algorithm</strong>:</li>
<li>Used cascading elitism (based on μ +λ ES)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="board-game-rules">Board game rules</h2>
<p><strong>Representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>board layouts and rules are represented as strings
<strong>Evaluation</strong>:</li>
<li>using different values for a weighted sum</li>
<li>E.g how long was the game, did it end in a draw, how many rules were used
<strong>Algorithm</strong>:</li>
<li>A relatively standard genetic algorithm was used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="galactic-arms-race">Galactic Arms Race</h2>
<p><strong>Representation</strong>: many neural networds, which increases its complexity over generations
<strong>Evaluation</strong>: fitness value assigned to each weapon, on the usage of the weapon. the more the weapon is played, the more probable the weapon will evolve.
<strong>Algorithm</strong>: collective, distributed evolutionary algorithm</p>
