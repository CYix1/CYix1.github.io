    <meta name="description" content="Spatial stories are not badly constructed stories; rather, they are stories which respond to alternative aesthetic principles, privileging spatial exploration over plot development. Spatial stories are held together by broadly defined goals and conflicts and pushed forward by the character‘s movement across the map. ~ Henry Jenkins 2004
Basically a Spatial story can happen in every location or during traversal between different location ~ Yixuan Cui 2025 LOL
Similar/relating concepts (Spatial narrative):
Environmental Storytelling (Carson 2000)
- Story element infused into the physical space. Conveying a story through this space.
Evocative Spaces
- Drawing upon previously existing narratives. e.g story &ldquo;traditions&rdquo;
Embedded Spaces
- Information distributed across the Gamespace through explicit narratives (text, audio, visuals)
Stages Areas:
- a stage for the player to develop their own story
Emergent narrative
- Stories in the game shape themself through their gameplay e.g Minecraft or Sims
Enacting Stories
- enable players to experience narrative events using micronarratives">
