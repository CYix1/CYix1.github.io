  <p>Spatial stories are not badly constructed stories; rather, they are stories which respond to <strong>alternative aesthetic principles</strong>, <strong>privileging spatial exploration over plot development</strong>. Spatial stories are held together by broadly defined goals and conflicts and pushed forward by the characterâ€˜s movement across the map. ~ Henry Jenkins 2004</p>
<p>Basically a Spatial story can happen in every location or during traversal between different location ~ Yixuan Cui 2025 LOL</p>
<p>Similar/relating concepts (Spatial narrative):
Environmental Storytelling (Carson 2000)</p>
<ul>
<li>Story element infused into the physical space. Conveying a story through this space.
Evocative Spaces</li>
<li>Drawing upon previously existing narratives. e.g story &ldquo;traditions&rdquo;
Embedded Spaces</li>
<li>Information distributed across the Gamespace through explicit narratives (text, audio, visuals)
Stages Areas:</li>
<li>a stage for the player to develop their own story
Emergent narrative</li>
<li>Stories in the game shape themself through their gameplay e.g Minecraft or Sims
Enacting Stories</li>
<li>enable players to experience narrative events using micronarratives</li>
</ul>
