Spatial stories are not badly constructed stories; rather, they are stories which respond to **alternative aesthetic principles**, **privileging spatial exploration over plot development**. Spatial stories are held together by broadly defined goals and conflicts and pushed forward by the characterâ€˜s movement across the map. ~ Henry Jenkins 2004

Basically a Spatial story can happen in every location or during traversal between different location ~ Yixuan Cui 2025 LOL
