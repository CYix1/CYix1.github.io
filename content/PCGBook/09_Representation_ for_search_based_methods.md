* There are many representations for PCG
* representation of not only the contetn but also the generation algorithm itself
* representations can be tailored to extend the search-based paradigm
* e.g providing required content, a multi-step genotype-to-phenotype mapping
* compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs)
  * neural network that maps position in some space to some property of pixels or particles.
